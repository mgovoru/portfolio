This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Technologies

The application uses the following tools and technologies:

- TypeScript — for type safety and easier code maintenance.
- Next.js — for building a web application.
- React — for creating dynamic user interfaces.
- CSS/SCSS/Styled Components — for styling pages.
- Built-in image optimization from Next.js — for improved performance and media handling.

This application is my personal portfolio, where I showcase my achievements, works, and skills.
